## Project Overview

This project, **"Health and Wellness Insights: From Prevention to Perception,"** is a data-driven **story** that uses interactive visualizations to explore health trends across the United States. Presented as a sequence of **five dashboards**, this story aims to provide insights into various aspects of public health, preventive practices, and risk behaviors. Through this journey, users can uncover patterns and relationships that inform decisions about public health and wellness.

## Story Structure

The story is composed of five interconnected dashboards:

1. **Introduction**
   - Provides an overview of the storyâ€™s theme, setting the stage for data exploration.
   - Introduces the objectives of the analysis, helping viewers understand the focus areas.

2. **Overview**
   - Highlights key health metrics and demographics across the United States, such as average BMI, heart disease incidents, and general health scores.
   - Visual elements include maps, demographic breakdowns, and summaries of behaviors like smoking, drinking, and physical activity levels across different age and gender groups.

3. **Trends**
   - Explores chronic disease trends across the country and identifies patterns in health status by age group and demographic category.
   - Includes visualizations such as state-level maps of chronic conditions, bar charts showing the distribution of diseases by age group, and scatter plots analyzing mental health metrics.

4. **Risk & Prevention**
   - Focuses on preventive healthcare, covering data on health check-ups, vaccinations, and risk factors.
   - Interactive filters allow viewers to explore correlations between COVID-19 positivity, vaccine status, and general health outcomes.
   - Additional charts analyze the distribution of preventive check-ups and disease prevalence across demographics.

5. **Summary**
   - Wraps up the story by summarizing the main findings and insights derived from the data.
   - Sections provide context on vaccination impact, preventive care, and the relationship between chronic diseases and lifestyle factors.
   - Concludes with recommendations for enhancing public health based on observed patterns.

## Data Source

The story uses data from the `Heart.csv` file, which contains information on health behaviors, chronic conditions, preventive measures, and general wellness across various demographics in the United States. This data enables a comprehensive exploration of health trends and factors impacting wellness.

## Key Insights

- **Preventive Care Matters**: Individuals who prioritize regular health check-ups and vaccinations generally report better health outcomes and lower incidences of severe conditions.
- **Demographic Variations**: Health conditions and wellness indicators vary significantly by age, gender, and region, pointing to opportunities for targeted interventions.
- **Chronic Health Trends**: Common chronic diseases like asthma, arthritis, and depression are analyzed across demographics, highlighting specific groups that may need targeted healthcare resources.
- **Risk Behavior Impact**: Smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity are associated with poorer health outcomes, underscoring the need for behavior-based health initiatives.

## Project Files

- **Dashboard Screenshots**: Images provided in the repository offer previews of each dashboard in the story.
- **Data File**: `Heart.csv` - the main dataset used for visualizations.
